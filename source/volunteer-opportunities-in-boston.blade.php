<h2>Things To Consider Before Volunteering</h2>
<p>If you’re planning to do one-time or regular <strong>volunteering in Boston</strong> (or anywhere else), it’s helpful to keep in mind <a href="https://www.volunteer-opportunities.org/questions-before-volunteering/" target="_blank">important factors</a> that will make the experience a success for everyone. Consider your interests, the skill sets you can contribute (or learn), and the kinds of roles that will be a good fit for your personality. If you’re an extrovert, public-facing work might suit you best; if you’re an introvert, you may prefer donating your time in a behind-the-scenes capacity.</p>
