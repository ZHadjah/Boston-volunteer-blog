<p>When many people think about Massachusetts, they first think of Boston. However, the entire Commonwealth—<a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/citizenship/learn/a-growing-nation/64/learn" target="_blank">one of the original 13 colonies</a> of what later became the United States—is rich in history, natural resources, and opportunities for unique experiences. If you know and love all the things that make Massachusetts special, you can preserve them for future generations by attending fundraising and other volunteering events with relevant nonprofit organizations. Here are just a few things to explore in every corner of this quintessentially New England state.</p>

<h2>Things To Do in Salem Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Salem is best known for its <a href="https://www.salem.org/salem-witch-trials/" target="_blank">1692 witch trials</a>, but there’s far more to this picturesque town northeast of Boston, and many ways to better understand its history. Popular places and activities include:</p>
<ul>

<p>Southeast Massachusetts is full of quaint small towns and villages as well as the popular coastal communities of Cape Cod, Martha’s Vineyard, and Nantucket. Here are just a few stellar destinations and things to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beaches and lighthouses</li>
<li>Seafood dining</li>
<li>Marine and maritime museums</li>

<ul>If you live in Massachusetts, one activity you can always do is give back to your community and help to preserve its cultural and environmental treasures by supporting local nonprofits. Volunteering is a great way to learn more about this state’s history and the causes that help to make it a just and healthy place. If you’re unsure where to start, consider attending a local <a href="https://www.meetup.com/BostonVolunteer/events/" target="_blank">nonprofit information, cleanup, or fundraising event</a>. Some organizations, like Boston Volunteer, offer fun events of this kind in both Boston and surrounding Massachusetts communities.</p>
